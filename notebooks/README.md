# Notebooks

This folder contains the main Jupyter notebooks used for data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and model training for the project.  

## Contents

- **DATASCI_112_Final_Project.ipynb**  
  - Scrapes app store review data.  
  - Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.  
  - Converts the raw data into structured data frames.  
  - Performs exploratory and statistical analyses on review content and patterns.  

- **Training_GPT.ipynb**  
  - Trains a GPT-based model on hand-coded data.  
  - Automates additional coding of review data using the trained model.  
  - Evaluates model performance by testing interrater reliability between human coders and the GPT model.  

## Purpose

These notebooks form the core workflow of the project:
1. **Data Acquisition & Preparation** → scraping and transforming raw reviews into analyzable data.  
2. **Data Analysis** → identifying trends, differences, and insights across app categories.  
3. **Model Training & Validation** → leveraging GPT to scale up coding efforts and ensure reliability.  

Together, they provide both the foundation of the dataset and the methodology for analyzing review content at scale.
