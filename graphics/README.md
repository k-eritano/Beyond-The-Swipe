# Key Findings on User Reviews and Sentiment

## Review Length and Star Rating
The length of a review is a strong indicator of user sentiment.  
- Reviews with **1–2 stars** are significantly longer (31–34 words on average).  
- **5-star reviews** are much shorter (around 9 words).

This suggests that users with negative experiences are more likely to write detailed, descriptive feedback, while satisfied users tend to leave short, positive reviews.

## Negative vs. Positive Sentiment
There is a clear disparity in user sentiment across different app genres:  
- **Queer (Primarily Sapphic) apps** (e.g., Zoe, Her) → highest proportion of positive reviews, lowest negative reviews.  
- **Exclusive apps** (e.g., The League) and **Queer (Primarily Men) apps** (e.g., Grindr) → extremely high proportions of negative sentiment.
