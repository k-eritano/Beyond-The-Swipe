# Key Findings on User Reviews and Sentiment

## Review Length and Star Rating

#### Average Review Length and Rating
The length of a review is a strong indicator of user sentiment.  
- Reviews with **1–2 stars** are significantly longer (31–34 words on average).  
- **5-star reviews** are much shorter (around 9 words).

This suggests that users with negative experiences are more likely to write detailed, descriptive feedback, while satisfied users tend to leave short, positive reviews.

#### Review Length and Rating by Category

- **Religious apps** and **Senior-focused apps** showed steady, moderately long reviews (≈17–30 words) with little variation across star ratings.  
- **Mainstream apps** and **Queer Co-ed apps** displayed sharp contrasts: reviews for **1–2 stars** were much longer (≈47–69 words) compared to **5-star reviews** (≈3–13 words). Negative feedback was expressed in much greater detail, while positive feedback was short and minimal.  
- **Exclusive apps** (e.g., members-only or curated platforms) had relatively short reviews overall (≈6–18 words), regardless of rating, suggesting concise but not highly detailed feedback.  
- **Queer Sapphic apps** showed a clear split: negative reviews were moderately long (≈25–35 words), while positive reviews were extremely brief (≈2–5 words).  
- **Queer Men’s apps** had a similar but more extreme pattern, with negative reviews (≈50–60 words) far longer than positive reviews (≈3–10 words).
